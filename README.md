# REST API Course Work

> The project is a REST API built using Django and React.js. It aims to provide a web-based interface for interacting with the API endpoints. The Django framework is used for the backend implementation, handling the data models, routing, and business logic. React.js is used for the frontend, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.

You can request to the API by the link http://16.171.199.194:8000/api/ to get access to the documentation.
